# Game Is Hard Guide 🧩

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **[GameIsHard.org](https://gameishard.org)**!

## 📖 About Us

**Game Is Hard Guide** is the premier independent companion site for the mobile trivia and puzzle game *"[Game Is Hard](https://gameishard.org)"*, published by Unico Studio.

The game is famous for its "gotcha" mechanics—where the question on the screen is rarely the real puzzle. Solutions often involve device exploration like tilting, shaking, multi-touch gestures, or interacting with UI elements you assumed were just decoration.

**Our Mission:**
We created this site to help players when "thinking harder" isn't enough. We provide:

* **Full Level Walkthroughs**: Step-by-step text and video guides.
* **Instant Answers**: Clear solutions for when you are completely stuck.
* **Core Strategies**: Tips on how to "audit" a level by testing gestures, permissions, and hidden UI elements.

> **Note:** We are an independent fan site created for informational purposes only. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Unico Studio.

## 🚀 Quick Tips

If you want to solve levels without looking up the answer, try these "Audits":

1. **Text Audit**: Tap the words in the prompt; they might be interactive.
2. **Gesture Audit**: Try pinching, dragging with two fingers, or shaking your device.
3. **Permission Audit**: If the level implies sound or camera, check if you granted the app permissions.
